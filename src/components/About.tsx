      <h1>About me</h1>
      <p>
        I&apos;m a web developer located in Joinville-SC, south of Brazil. My
        interest in programming started in 2016 when I had my first contact with
        the algorithm discipline on an Engineer course.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since 2021, I&apos;ve worked for two local companies and now searching
        for a remote job.
      </p>
      <p>
        I believe that soft skills are as important as hard skills and
        languages/stacks are just tools. Surfing, skating, and hiking are some
        activities that I enjoy doing.
