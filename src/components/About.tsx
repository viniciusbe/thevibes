      <h1>About me</h1>
      <p>
        Hi, my name is Vin√≠cius Bernardes and I am a frontend developer based in
        Joinville-SC, located in the south of Brazil. My passion for programming
        began in 2016 when I was first introduced to algorithmic principles
        while pursuing an Engineering degree.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over the past few years, I have gained valuable experience through my
        work with two local companies. Now, I am eager to apply my skills and
        knowledge to a remote position.
      </p>
      <p>
        I believe that soft skills are just as important as hard skills, and
        that programming languages and technology stacks are simply tools. In my
        free time, I enjoy activities such as surfing, skating, and hiking,
        which allow me to maintain a healthy work-life balance.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am excited about the prospect of collaborating with like-minded
        individuals to create impactful projects and deliver innovative
        solutions. Thank you for taking the time to learn a bit more about me.
